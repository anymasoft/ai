REVERT LOG
==========

Reverted the following erroneous commits:
- 10de876: fix: move conditional UI styles to global scope
- f6f930b: feat: implement conditional UI modes (no-video/has-video)
- ccfcf90: fix: restore glass morphism effect to all UI elements

Reason: These commits attempted to implement NO-VIDEO/HAS-VIDEO conditional UI modes
but the approach was flawed (scoped CSS couldn't reach parent classes from components).

Current state: Reverted to commit e47b9e4 
(feat: remove icons from QuickActions and add shadcn-style tooltips)
